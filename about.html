          <p class="speech">Sports are an essential part of the growth and development of a child. They assist in developing the body's mental health and physical fitness. A student gains different abilities, experience and trust through participation in sports and games, which help develop their personality. Not only does continuous work tire you, but it also decreases your productivity. So, it's better to have a sports activity adopted to have better productivity and focus.</p>
